        <h2>Expectation Studying In Turkey</h2>
        <p>
          I know that relation and communication is the important thing in
          modern era nowadays. I hope if I can study in Turkey, I get not only a
          formal education, but also an informal one such as good relation with
          international people. I also hope that I can follow conferences about
          sensor and IOT technology. Having studied electrical and electronic
          Engineering in Turkey, my future plan is to create a portable
          electrical generator. I will create this device to help Indonesian
          kids in desolate area, because I see a lot of them still struggling to
          get an electrical lighting until now. I also plan to run a private
          enterprise in the field of sensor technology. I will make it known to
          the world that Indonesia’s youth generation could also create its own
          sensor technology. Then, I will work together with agricultural
          engineer to develop this sensor technology for Indonesian Farmer. So
          Indonesian farmer can grow their plants in efficient way, and also can
          increase their harvest.

        <h2>Reasons I choose EEE</h2>
        <p>
          I choose electrical and electronic engineering because I have been
          interested in development The Internet Of Things (IOT) from a well
          known company, such as Intel Corporation. With IOT technology, human
          life will be easier, and every aspect in human life will become smart
          and integrate with one another by smart sensor and processor. This
          integration will produce so many benefits for people especially for
          Indonesian Government. With IOT technology, Indonesian government can
          increase citizen prosperity especially in agriculture. For example,
          when government puts a humid, nutrition control and others sensors, it
          will be easy to identify problems and determine a proper policy to
          solve them and increase the yield products. Developing smart sensor
          and processor for IOT is highly related with mathematics and physics.
          I am sure that my good ability in those fields and my experience in
          Physics competition will help me to become an expert in developing
          those components for IOT technology.

        <h2>The reasons why I choose Turkey</h2>
        <p>
          I choose Turkey because I have a dream to study in this country since
          I was a little boy. The dream came because my father always tell me a
          story about Sultan Muhammad Al-Fatih, the young warrior who prove
          Rasulullah’s word and about an extraordinary Islamic architect named
          Mimar Sinan . I also choose Turkey for pursue my undergraduate studies
          because it has many great universities in the field of engineering
          particularly. As a developed country, I think Turkey is the right
          place to study and pursue my ambition to become a multipurpose
          engineer. The last reason I choose Turkey is, because I want to
          promote Indonesia’s culture in traditional dancing to people in Asia
          and Europe. I love do Indonesia’s dancing because it make a huge
          positive energy although I only can danced two kind dances so far,
          still I have a ambition to spread this positive energy by teaching
          another people about it. And I want to learn a traditional dance from
          Turkey, and then combined it with Indonesia’s dance.
